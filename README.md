DESIGN DECISIONS - I really wanted my site to be sleek and minimal. I used Barbara Prey's website as inspiration
                   because I liked the gray/blue color scheme and the simplicity. I used the same color scheme for 
                   my site. I used the blue to emphasize importance (Pamela Morgan Halpert at the top) and the gray
                   for subheadings. I also made it so that when blue things are hovered over, they turn to the gray
                   and vice versa. I think I took advantage of natural gaze patterns with the title. I made her name
                   blue and the largest thing on the page to attract attention. I also thought the left then right
                   pattern of where the pictures are placed in the artwork page would force the users eyes to explore 
                   more. Since I'm using a fictional character from the beloved "The Office" show, I figured most 
                   of the audience would be "The Office" fans. To cater to them, I tried to reference some funny office
                   bits (ex: asian jim family photo, dwight as a buyer, kevin chili gif). I chose the sleek and minimal 
                   design to mimic Pam's style, which is very minimal and professional. 
              
CHALLENGE - I think I really challenged myself with this project. I've never created an html site from scratch before
            and haven't had that much experience with html in general. I've also never used jekyll before. So, through
            this project, I definitely gained a lot of technical skills in the html department. I spent a lot of time
            looking up different ways to do cool things. For example, it took me a really long time to figure out how
            to put an image and text in the same line. The contact page also took me a lot of time (and help) to figure 
            out. I actually really enjoyed the process. I think I learned a ton from the basic setup to some more advanced 
            stuff with layouts. Another aspect I didn't have a lot of experience with is GitHub. In fact, I only created
            a GitHub account earlier this year for this class. I hadn't yet had to use it on my own, either. So, that
            was definitely a challenge and I had to spend some time trying to figure out why my GitHub pages stuff wasn't
            working. However, I think I have a really good handle on it now and I'm excited that I can turn any website I
            want into a link that I can easily send to family and friends!

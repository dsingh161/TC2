    	Pam Halpert originally began her journey into the world of art as a <br /> 
    	receptionist for Dunder Mifflin Inc. (a paper company) in Scranton, <br /> 
    	Pennsylvania. She was then accepted into the Pratt Institute where  <br />
    	she began to hone her skills. Many of her pieces from her student   <br />
    	art show at the end of her time at the Institute are shown on this  <br />
    	site. After her time at the Institute, she returned to Dunder       <br />
    	Mifflin Inc. for a time (with a brief stint at the Michael Scott    <br />
    	Paper Company). Eventually, she returned to her true passion: art.  <br />
    	She now lives in Austin, Texas as a freelance painter and an art    <br />
    	gallery owner. She lives with her husband, Jim, and two beautiful   <br />
    	children, Cecilia and Philip (all shown to the left).
